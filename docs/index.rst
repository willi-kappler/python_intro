.. Advanced Python course

Welcome to the advanced Python course
=====================================

In this course you will learn how to write Python programs that do calculations, read and write data
to the filesystem and visualize it.

Exercises may be the most important part of this module container. We suggest that you do them
actively and in small groups. Really, the only way to learn Python is to do it.
