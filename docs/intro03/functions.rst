Functions in Phython
====================

You already know several functions in python, such as print, range, len. Behind these words stand a block of code
which will only be executed when you call the function. Let's look at the example of the function len. When you
want to find out the length of a vector, i.e. how many characters there are in a string, you can use the following
statement:

.. code-block:: python

    l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    print(len(l))

    # Output: 5

When using a function, you pass data, known as parameters, in this case you use the variable a, into the function.
Python then runs the function and returns the results. You can find more detail about the len-function here:

Why to use or define functions? It is an abstraction method to enable re-usage parts of a code again.
